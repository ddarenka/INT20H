### How to run our code properly?
- [Download Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), if you don't have it installed yet.

- Create a new local folder to clone this github-repository on your computer.

- Execute these commands in the command prompt at created folder (type `cmd` at your folder's path bar):
  - `git init`
  - `git clone https://github.com/ddarenka/INT20H.git`
  - `jupyter-notebook`.
  
- Click the `Upload` button and navigate to the repository you've previously created and find `jupyter` folder.

- Choose file `machine_learning_approach_linear_svc_grid.ipynb` in it.

- Enjoy :)

*You also can try `Kernel` -> `Restart & Run all` at will to check the code working.*
