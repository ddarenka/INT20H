### How to run our code properly?
- [Download Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), if you don't have it installed yet.
- Create a new local folder to clone this github-repository on your computer and execute these commands in your command line:
  - `git init`
  - `git clone https://github.com/ddarenka/INT20H.git`
  - `jupyter-notebook`.
- Go to the repository you've previously created and find 'jupyter' folder and 'file machine_learning_approach_linear_svc_grid.ipynb' in it.
- Open it.
- Enjoy :)
